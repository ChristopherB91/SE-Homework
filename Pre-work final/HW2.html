  <p>During my time playing chess I met amazing friends and teachers who helped me improve and grow as a person.</p>
  <p>Something I enjoyed about playing chess is I got to meet people like Ray Romano, Ruben Diaz the Bronx borough president, CC Sabathia after a mets game, and see Serena Williams play in the U.S open.</p>
  <p>Another thing I loved about playing chess is that when I started playing my dad brothers and even my aunt got into playing chess aswell.</p>
